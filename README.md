## Project 1
Project 1 focuses on the initial stages of software development, including the creation of a use case diagram, activity diagrams, and the formulation of Gherkin code. The diagrams have been designed using StarUML to depict system interactions and process flows.

- Code in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) and diagrams made with [StarUML](https://staruml.io/).

## Project 2
Project 2 includes static class modeling, dynamic modeling and applied design patterns, and is a continuation of the previous.

- Diagrams made with [StarUML](https://staruml.io/).   

## Project 3
Project 3 includes designing an API for the app, based on the FRs and NFRs chosen in the first part of the project.

- API made using [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) with [Swagger Editor](https://swagger.io/).
